      <p1>Before the final whistle, before the chants of “Equal pay!” ricocheted around Stade de Lyon, before Megan Rapinoe’s arms were filled with all the trophies a soccer player could possibly earn in one year, first came the tears.On July 7, in the 61st minute of the 2019 World Cup final against the Netherlands, Rapinoe scored to put the U.S. up 1–0. To her, though, this was more than the goal that would win the Americans a record fourth title. It was the equivalent of flashing double-barrel middle fingers. She’d have loved to have done that just once. But, she says, “there are lines.”The goal itself, on a penalty kick drawn by teammate Alex Morgan, was, like Rapinoe, more about brains than brawn. She reminded herself, Your opponent is more nervous than you are, then she went low and a bit right, breaking her tendency of high and left. Dutch goalkeeper Sari van Veenendaal flinched toward Rapinoe’s usual side, the net rippled, teammates swarmed and the whole scene ended with the pink-haired lesbian winger posing near the corner flag in defiance and triumph and joy: arms outstretched, chin up, head tipped just back.megan-rapinoe-the-pose.

      <p2>The Pose, the signature sporting image of 2019, was more than a celebration, just as Rapinoe’s goal was more than a tournament-winner. No one knew this better than Rapinoe’s mom, Denise, and fraternal twin, Rachael, who together had traversed France for a month with the U.S. team and on the day of the final were sitting just down the sideline. They were there because Megan had laid it on thick that this might be her last World Cup (she’ll reassess after the 2020 Olympics) but also because they know she can be as sensitive as she is tough, and even those who appear superhuman need support. Especially if they’ve been publicly questioned by the leader of the free world.For 34 years, since Megan was born 11 minutes after Rachael—since they learned to play soccer together at age five, since they came out to each other as gay when they were sophomores at the University of Portland—one sister has fortified the other. In France that meant Rachael pulled Megan aside during a family visitation hour in a hotel lobby, sheltering her from all the fuss and all the paranoia from U.S. Soccer officials who feared the muscle stimulator on Rapinoe’s ailing right hamstring might tip off the world that she’d be missing the semifinal against England. It had meant, years earlier, hiding from Megan the hateful emails that came pouring into Rapinoe SC, a clinics-and-online-apparel company that the sisters run together, after Megan joined an NFL quarterback’s lonely protest during the national anthem.All of which had led to this day. Rapinoe was the hero of the World Cup, achieving everything she’d ever dreamed of, but in so many ways it was unlike anything she’d imagined. And so, 16 minutes after her final goal, in her 428th minute of play over five matches, she was substituted out and sat down, just across a divider from the U.S. family seats. As the final seconds ticked off the clock, the sisters locked eyes. And they started bawling.

      <p3>About the size of a Mini Cooper car, Hopeis to arrive in orbit around Mars in February. The spacecraft — which cost about $200 million to build and launch — will carry three instruments: an infrared spectrometer, an ultraviolet spectrometer and a camera.

      From its high orbit — varying from 12,400 miles to 27,000 miles above the surface — Hope will give planetary scientists their first global view of Martian weather at all times of day. Over its two-year mission, it will investigate how dust storms and other weather phenomena near the Martian surface speed or slow the loss of the planet’s atmosphere into space.

      That, however, is not the main reason that the Emirates government built Hope.

      “A lot of you might ask us, ‘Why space?’” Omran Sharaf, the Hope project manager, said during a news conference on Thursday. “It’s not about reaching Mars.”

      Rather, Mr. Sharaf said, the country’s primary aim is to inspire schoolchildren and spur its science and technology industries, which, in turn, will enable the Emirates to tackle critical issues like food, water, energy and a post-petroleum economy.</p3>

      <p4>“It’s about starting getting the ball rolling,” Mr. Sharaf said, “and creating that disruptive change, and changing the mind-set.”

      The Emirates previously built and launched three earth-observing satellites, collaborating with a South Korean manufacturer and gradually taking on greater shares of the engineering. The country even has a nascent human spaceflight program. Last year, the U.A.E. bought a seat on a Russian Soyuz rocket and sent its first astronaut, Hazzaa al-Mansoori, for an eight-day stay at the International Space Station.

      For the Mars mission, the country took a similar approach to the earlier satellites by working with the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics at the University of Colorado Boulder, where Hope was built before being sent to Dubai for testing.

      By design, Emirati engineers worked side by side with their counterparts in Boulder, learning as they designed and assembled the spacecraft. “One of the requirements that the government gave us since the beginning,” Mr. Sharaf said, “they told us, ‘You have to build it and not buy it.’”

      The science piece of the mission was an even bigger gap to fill for a country without Mars scientists, which until recently constituted an unfathomable career choice.

      <blockquote> “For the Emirates, it’s more about the journey,” Mr. Sharaf said. “It’s more about the impact. Reaching there is one of the goals. But that doesn’t mean that the mission has failed, if we didn’t manage to get there. So failure is an option.” </blockquote>

      Ms. al-Amiri is the head of science even though she never formally studied planetary science.

      After she graduated college with a computer science degree, the likeliest job prospects — working at a networking company performing troubleshooting and maintenance — did not enrapture her. She wanted to design and build new things.

      She saw a job posting at what is now known as the Mohammed bin Rashid Space Center in Dubai. She joined in 2009, working as an engineer on the satellite programs. When that assignment wrapped up in 2014, she moved on to her current roles on the Hope mission.

      She now also serves as the country’s minister of state for advanced sciences and chairs an advisory council of scientists.

      If the U.A.E. had tried to train planetary scientists from scratch to work on Hope, the mission would have been long over before the scientists were ready. Instead, Emirati officials took a quicker approach: converting some of the space center’s engineers into scientists by offering apprentice-like training with researchers in the United States.

      “I was put there to develop scientific talents within the organization and be able to transfer knowledge in a nontraditional way,” Ms. al-Amiri said.

      The coronavirus outbreak tossed in more challenges.

      Once construction of the spacecraft was complete in Colorado, a large Ukrainian transport plane ferried it to Dubai, where it was to undergo a round of testing before heading to the launchpad in Japan.

      But at the end of February — not long before the European Space Agency and Russia postponed the launch of the Rosalind Franklin mission in part because of the logistical hurdles created by the pandemic — Mr. Sharaf and Ms. al-Amiri realized the outbreak could disrupt their carefully planned schedules if airports were shut down.

      “Based on that, we started working on a plan to get the team across to Japan as soon as possible,” Ms. al-Amiri said.

      They shuffled some of the tests in order to hurry the spacecraft to Japan, three weeks earlier than originally planned, and where some of the testing would instead be completed.</p4>

      <p5>Travel restrictions meant team members could not travel back and forth. A small team went ahead in early April to wait out a quarantine. Two weeks later, the cargo plane with Hope flew to Japan with another small team from the Emirates.

      In Japan, the people who flew with Hope then went into quarantine and then those who had gone ahead joined the spacecraft on the barge trip to the island that is home to the launch site.

      Mr. Sharaf and Ms. al-Amiri said the mission was now ready, and the nation’s space program would continue regardless of the outcome.

      “The Emirates fully understand the risk associated with this mission,” Mr. Sharaf said. “So does the team. Let’s be honest. Fifty percent of the missions that have been to Mars have failed.”

      The greatest success is the training of the people, he said.

      “For the Emirates, it’s more about the journey,” Mr. Sharaf said. “It’s more about the impact. Reaching there is one of the goals. But that doesn’t mean that the mission has failed, if we didn’t manage to get there. So failure is an option.”</p5>
